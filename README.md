### Racket Bezier Module

This module provides three simple utilities for arbitrary-degree bezier curves:
- finding the point some proportion of the way along a curve
- finding `n` evenly spaced points along a curve
- drawing a curve at a controllable resolution onto anything that provides the racket `dc<%>` drawing context interface
